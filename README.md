# GravyMoat

*Not as hot as lava, but still sticky.*


A doomed attempt at rebuilding LavaMoat with Node.js loaders.

try it:
```bash
  npm install && \
  npm start
```

go to `register.js` and try different policies from the list.

Or take a quickl look at [examples](./examples.md)


> Note: It's using a simplified policy and doesn't support relative specifiers inside node_modules, so don't change the example too much
