# GravyMoat

Not as hot as lava, but still sticky.

A doomed attempt at rebuilding LavaMoat with Node.js loaders.

try it:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/boneskull/hooks-test && \
  cd hooks-test && \
  npm install && \
  npm start
```

go to register.js and try different policies from the list.


Note: It's using a simplified policy and doesn't support relative specifiers inside node_modules, so don't change the example much
