# GravyMoat

_Not as hot as lava, but still sticky._

> A cursed attempt at rebuilding LavaMoat with Node.js' [module customization hooks](https://nodejs.org/api/module.html#customization-hooks).

## Prerequisites

Node.js v20.0.0+

## Try It

Install and run:

```bash
npm install && npm start
```

You can then:

- Open `register.js` and try different policies from the list. Try your own!
- Feeling lazy? You can see [what would happen](./examples.md) if you did.

> Note: It's using a simplified policy and doesn't support relative specifiers inside `node_modules`, so don't change the example too much

The gravy is not fit for human consumption.
